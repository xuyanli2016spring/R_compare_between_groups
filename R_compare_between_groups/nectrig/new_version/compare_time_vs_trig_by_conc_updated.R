# Note: This script is used for comparing the nectrig_vs_time of the same concentrations among different groups, the output is one plot for every concentration.
# Every plot includes all the lines from different groups at a specific contration
# How to use this script: open terminal, cd to the directory of this script, enter command R will
# make the terminal work under R, then enter command source("compare_time_vs_trig_by_conc_updated.R"), the script will start working 
# Input files: To compare n groups of experiments, every group of experiments has m "nectrig.csv" files in the its directory: for example, if you want to 
# compare two groups of experiemtns, then you should put the two groups of experiemtns("nectrig.csv" files) in two different directories. 

# The following is an example to run this script
# > source("compare_time_vs_trig_by_conc_updated.R")
# Please input the number of groups of experiments you would like to compare, for example 2: 2
# Please input the directory of experiments of group 1: /Users/yanlixu/Desktop/experiment_data_2017/exp_2016_12_31_to_2017_01_07/exp_2016_12_31_to_2017_01_01
# Please input a name to distinguish this group, for example, infusion_liver: m1
# Please input the directory of experiments of group 2: /Users/yanlixu/Desktop/experiment_data_2017/exp_2016_12_31_to_2017_01_07/exp_2017_01_05_to_2017_01_07
# Please input a name to distinguish this group, for example, infusion_liver: m2
# Please input 2 different colors to represent different groups, you may choose from these colors, black, blue, green, red, burlywood4, forestgreen, firebrick, blue4, purple, chocolate, cyan, gold, darkviolet, brown: black, red
# Please input the number of experiments in every group, for example 9: 2
# You have  2  experiments in every group, please input how many rows and columns you would like to display the plots, for example (3, 3): 1, 2
# Enter 2 concentration values in every group and separated by comma: 0.1, 0.5
# Please input the cycleLimit of these experiments: 21600
# You already got the first plot, please input x and y coordinates to put legends: 0, 25000
