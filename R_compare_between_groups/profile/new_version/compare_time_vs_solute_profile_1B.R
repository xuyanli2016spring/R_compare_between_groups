# Note: This script is used for compare the solute vs time in profile among different groups, the output is one plot for one solute of all the concentrations in every group. 
# How to use this script: open terminal, cd to the directory of this script, enter command R will
# make the terminal work under R, then enter command source("compare_time_vs_solute_profile_1B.R"), the script will start working 
# Input files: To compare n groups of experiments, every group of experiments has m "mean_profile.csv" files in its directory: for example, if you want to 
# compare two groups of experiments, then you should put the two groups of experiments(".csv" files) in two different directories. 
# One example created by this script: 8 pages of plots, every page is for one sulte and have 2 plots, every plot includes the lines from all the concentrations in one group

# An example to run this script
# > source("compare_time_vs_solute_profile_1B.R")
# Please input the number of groups of experiments you would like to compare, for example 2: 2
# Please input the directory of experiments of group 1: /Users/yanlixu/Desktop/experiment_data/bolus_in_2016_12/161215_161219/exp_data_0p1_to_0p9
# Please input a name to distinguish this group, for example, infusion_liver: bolus_liver
# Please input the directory of experiments of group 2: /Users/yanlixu/Desktop/experiment_data/bolus_in_2016_12/161220_161225/bolus_exp_data
# Please input a name to distinguish this group, for example, infusion_liver: bolus_culture
# Please input the number of experiments in every group, for example 9: 9
# Enter 9 concentration values in every group and separated by comma: 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9
# Please input 9 different colors to represent different experiments, you may choose from these colors, black, blue, green, red, burlywood4, forestgreen, firebrick, blue4, purple, chocolate, cyan, gold, darkviolet, brown: black, blue, green, red, burlywood4, forestgreen, firebrick, blue4, purple
# You have  2  plots for every solute, please input how many rows and columns you would like to display the plots, for example (1, 2): 1, 2
# Please input the cycleLimit of these experiments: 21600
